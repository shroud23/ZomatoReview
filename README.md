# ZomatoReview
Developed an AI-based sentiment analysis model for Zomato restaurant reviews to assess customer sentiment.
Created a comprehensive data preprocessing pipeline in Python, optimizing the dataset stored in "review.csv" for analysis.
Utilized the overall rating as a key feature for sentiment analysis, combining numerical and textual data for improved accuracy.
Implemented advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze customer sentiments and extract valuable insights.
Demonstrated strong data analysis, machine learning, and text processing skills to enhance decision-making in the restaurant industry.
This project showcases my ability to work with real-world datasets, apply NLP methodologies, and deliver actionable insights through data-driven analysis and modeling.
